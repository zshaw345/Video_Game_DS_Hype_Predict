Each ship is designed to meet specialized standards so that no matter how young or old you are you can enjoy them just the same.

Most PixelShips are only a foot or two long and are flown using special devices called PICCs, or PixelShip Interface Command Consoles. The consoles have two joysticks and six buttons on each stick and can interface with any ship that has been registered into it. Some PICCs also have LCD displays so that you don't need a TV to see what your PixelShip sees while it flies.

Each PixelShip uses batteries, just like any other toy, though some use Micro-Reactors instead and are fueled at special facilities so that childeren cannot actually access the fuel inside. They are also designed out of segments held together by micro-magnets. When the ship is ""destroyed"" in combat, its micro-magnets disengage and the ship flies apart into its seperate segments, each still carrying a residual charge from the ship's anti-gravity unit. If all of the segments are then tagged by another PixelShip, that collector may then, under official guidelines, possess the ship if he so desires.

Classic PixelShips takes place in the year 2076 when a very secretive PixelShip has supposedly been built. Your task is to collect all 160 known PixelShips by earning them through campaign battles at the arena. Afterwards, you will be given access to a special campaign where you may earn this unique and unheard of PixelShip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part desktop simulator, part platformer, this is a game designed in 2.5 months for #PixelHorrorJam by myself & James_T_Ripper 
 
Inspired by the popular titles Welcome To The Game & Pony Island, File requires the mouse to be controlled in order to maneuver Raven's computer in search of a set of programs, each more horrifying as you progress. 
 
Controls: 
-Once a program is executed, the D/Right-Arrow Keys can be used to move the player right 
-Alternatively, the A/Left-Arrow Keys can be used to move the player left

Gates were one-way trips to random destinations, often taking one far across the galaxy. No-one knew a new gate's ultimate destination until it was finished and the first journey undertaken. 
 
Gatestriders, a nomadic colony of humanity, took pride in gate travel and the discovery of new areas of space. When resource rich planets were discovered, they would send Reaper teams to terraform the planet and mine its wealth for fortune and glory. 
 
One such foray inadvertently led them into a region of space deemed forbidden by the reclusive, yet powerful, Enshigi. 
 
The retaliation was swift, and ruthless. Within a week the Gatestriders lost their homeworld, their star sent nova by the Enshigi. 
 
The shattered society took to finding a new home for themselves. It was during this search that they came across the planet Em-8ER. This was where they encountered the Tsi-Hu: sentient, shapeshifting aliens who command huge creatures, known as Kaiju, into battle. This was how the war started.",,,4.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

FreeCell is a solitaire-based card game played with a 52-card standard deck. It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that nearly all deals can be solved. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).

Rules

Construction and layout:

* One standard 52-card deck is used.
* There are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.
* Cards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.

Building during play:

* The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.
* Tableaux must be built down by alternating colors.
* Foundations are built up by suit.

Moves:

* Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.
* Complete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. While computer implementations often show this motion, players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.

Victory:

* The game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.

For games with the standard layout (four open cells and eight cascades) most games are easily solved.

Supported Operations:
* Tap one column and tap another column, move the cards from the first column to second column if possible;
* Double Tap on the column's last card to move it to buffer area, if possible;
* Drag cards from one column to another column, if possible;
* Auto throw, cards will be throw to recycle automatically, if possible;
* Drag from recycle to columns to restore the recycled card, if possible;

With Auto-throw, it is much more convenient to finish the card puzzle!

When the solar explosions died, the humans decide to return to Earth. When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and taken far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is MT-ED's task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. 
 
To do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time. 
 
Besides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed. When MT-ED completed this sub-game, the Kat Men's Central Computer is disabled and the Kat Men go back where they came from.","[1, 18, 268435461]","[1, 18]",2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.igdb.com/games/kat-trap-planet-of-the-cat-men,,ea2af4f8-4326-1ac8-98b7-3ec1e4b30b7b,,"[49711, 49712, 49713]",,,,,,,,,,[4],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Card Game (or TCG for short, the only card game they play in space) is played by two players on a single board. Connect your cards to give them power, and when they're all fired up they deal damage, heal, shield, or mess with your opponents cards. Since they stay on the board after they've been activated, you can keep combos alive indefinitely by stringing new cards into the chain. Playing on the same board gives you opportunity to further mess with you opponents, blocking their moves or stealing their power!

While this game was released exclusively in Japan, it was later given an enhanced port under the name Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution with less characters.","[1, 268435460, 268435481, 268435487]",[1],2020-09-14 00:00:00,https://www.igdb.com/games/naruto-gekito-ninja-taisen-3,[125607],95316b49-cc60-7fef-0526-5f4938a9b470,,"[57937, 57938]","[12518, 12519, 27285]",,,55.0,0.0,55.0,0.0,,,,,[31455],2193.0,,19622.0,Clash of Ninja 3,,[221],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ghostlop is a head-to-head arcade style puzzle game featuring a unique mix of elements from Puzzle Bobble and Breakout, with a color-switching mechanic reminiscent of Silhouette Mirage and Ikaruga. 
 
You aim shots the same way as in Puzzle Bobble, but there are only two main colors of bubbles to destroy--or in this case ghosts. The A and B buttons determine whether your shot is red or blue. If your shot is the same color as the ghosts it hits, it will cut through them like in a bonus level of Alleyway. If it's the opposite color, it will bounce off without doing damage. You can switch as often as you like (even while the ball is bouncing around) so if there are a lot of red ghosts surrounded by a layer of blue ghosts, you could detach all of them from the top of the screen by throwing a blue shot to pass through the outer layer, switching to red to move through the middle, and then switching back to blue to pass out the other side, dropping the majority of the ghosts and putting a lot of garbage on your opponent's screen. As your ball bounces around you're free to move your character back and forth along the bottom of the screen, and you need to catch the ball when it comes back or suffer the penalty of having the pieces lower one notch. 
 
The action is fast-paced and smooth. The lighthearted characters and rockabilly music add a lot of charm that is missing from newer puzzle games like Lumines and Planet Puzzle League.",,,2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.igdb.com/games/ghostlop,,529b32f8-1972-76cf-c890-e5c58297942d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The player has a range of melee attacks that can be used against enemies, and can also evade the attacks of enemies.

Now, in the Bill & Ted's Most Excellent computer game, you'll meet some neat dead dudes, too- though you'll need more than two to pass that most heinous history exam!

At the Circle K, meet Rufus, an ultra-cool messenger and his time traveling phone booth. Just dial a year and take off in time. You're looking for a bodacious bunch of historical heavyweights to bring back to San Dimas High. This is an excellent arcade / action adventure, but only the coolest of dudes will be triumphant!

Can you find the answer for Socrates the philoso-fizer, take notes for Beethoven, fiddle with Nero and chill out with Joan of Arc (she's one hot chick, but it's ""Miss of Arc"" to you)? No way?! Yes, way! Genghis Khan likes Twinkies and Marie Antoinette is into cake, but how do you get Freud to leave his mother and get Mikey (Michaelangelo) off the ceiling? Don't forget that short, dead dude Napoleon, and there's Abe Lincoln and Billy the Kid. Plus, Uncle Al (relativ-ity) wanders randomly- hey, he's Einstein, whatcha gonna do!

Booty Diver is a retro arcade action game based on Atari/Nintendo games of yesteryear. The game take's a lot of inspiration from the unreleased Atari 2600 title Aquaventure. As the titular ""Diver"" you traverse 5 different regions of the ocean seeking out sunken treasure (Booty) guarded by King Poseidon ,and his guardians. 
These dives will not be a simple splash and grab though as you must manage a limited air supply while battling Poseidon's minions which include Starfish, Octopi, and etc. Do not threat though as the ""Diver"" has a few means to defend himself with his short range diver's knife ,and his trusty harpoon gun. 
 
There are 5 different regions of the ocean where you take 5 dive's per a region with each being capped off by a battle with a guardian. Some dives may require a bit more work than just battling through the monsters of the deep as you may need solve various unique challenges. After each difficulty mode play-thru it offers an unlock which gives incentive to return to the ocean depths one more time on a higher difficulty setting. 
 
The game offers full controller support with Xbox(360/One), and Dualshock 4 controllers which is the recommended way to play the game. Keyboard controls are also available although not recommended way to play. Each level has it's own chiptune soundtrack with the exception of the boss battles.","[1, 268435488]",[1],2021-10-01 09:11:55,https://www.igdb.com/games/booty-diver,"[57552, 57553]",dc36dc7b-0e0f-8325-29db-709df289ad69,"[27556, 27557]",[95885],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An augmented super-soldier must stop a renegade regime from eradicating the civilized world.  
 
Hong Kong, 2065. 2nd Lt. Nathan Frost is just a regular grunt in an international army called the Liberty Coalition. When he takes massive injuries from an explosion on the battlefield, Frost undergoes an experimental procedure. The outcome of the surgery is something more than human; a transformation that makes him a unique weapons-grade warrior, with abilities that far surpass those of the average soldier.  
 
Empowered with these extra-normal abilities via implanted augmentations, Frost is immediately sent to the frontlines of a war as a secret weapon against the destructive regime. Stranded in hostile territory, cut off from command and far outnumbered, Frost and a handful of men must try and stop the entire renegade militia's plan threatening to plunge the world into darkness.","[1, 18, 268435461, 536870933, 536870937, 536870952, 536871015, 536871044, 536871079, 536871355, 536871365, 536871378, 536871470, 536871475, 536871835, 536871882, 536871937, 536872009, 536872019, 536872070, 536872131, 536872245, 536872335, 536872352, 536872733, 536873753, 536873999, 536874539, 536874743, 536874810, 536875046, 536875073, 536875199, 536875257, 536875271, 536875358, 536875453, 536875483, 536875484, 536875523, 536875538, 536875539, 536875624, 536875689, 536875695, 536875802, 536875804, 536875811, 536875814, 536875874, 536876221, 536876222, 536876251, 536876262, 536876391, 536876551, 536876687, 536876726, 536876857, 536876875, 536877049, 536877161, 536877204, 536877234, 536877286, 536877433, 536877531, 536877533, 536877950, 536878004, 536878467, 536879013, 536879053, 536879995, 536880680, 536880839, 536881516, 536881988, 536882698, 536883028, 536883035, 536883107, 536883206, 536883354, 536883870, 536883875, 536884022, 536886314]","[1, 18]",2021-06-28 16:31:59,https://www.igdb.com/games/project-snowblind,"[2920, 40854, 40855]",10200fc1-4ddf-12bb-4f44-829676f74e13,"[6346, 10497]","[14405, 22590, 22591]",[3946],,,62.97682612956429,21.0,67.73841306478215,25.0,,"[21, 25, 40, 103, 132, 167, 443, 453, 466, 558, 563, 923, 970, 1025, 1097, 1107, 1158, 1219, 1333, 1423, 1440, 1821, 2841, 3087, 3627, 3831, 3898, 4134, 4161, 4287, 4345, 4359, 4446, 4541, 4571, 4572, 4611, 4626, 4627, 4712, 4777, 4783, 4890, 4892, 4899, 4902, 4962, 5309, 5310, 5339, 5350, 5479, 5639, 5775, 5814, 5945, 5963, 6137, 6249, 6292, 6322, 6374, 6521, 6619, 6621, 7038, 7092, 7555, 8101, 8141, 9083, 9768, 9927, 10604, 11076, 11786, 12116, 12123, 12195, 12294, 12442, 12958, 12963, 13110, 15402]",[1],[19207],[11574],,,,,,,3.0,,72.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,

He enters ""The Alternative Trivia Research Club"" where the first of his many sexual encounters takes place. Despite that, he finds out that both of his foster sisters are in love with him, and he has to make a choice—who does he really love. Nikita Shindou loves the world of animation more than anything; he puts his life into it. He has never fallen for a real, living girl, until the day he meets Ren Aoi. 
 
We're introduced to young man Nikita Shindou as he's making his way through Akihabara, which is his main haunt and the place where he gets all his bishōjo games, which he plays in his room all alone in the dark. Keeping them a secret from his sister who just moved in a few months ago after their parents had died, Nikita loves playing up the characters having sex with each other and manipulating them as he can. To his surprise on his way home though, he comes across a park he hadn't remembered before and sees a beautiful woman there, one that reminds him strikingly of an older Sheeta from Laputa: Castle in the Sky! Even more amazing is that she comes into his room in some sort of dream sequence not too much later and keeps calling him Pazu and the two fool around quite a bit only for it to end up as a dream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game was intended to be a promotional tie with Wimpy restaurants as their logos, company mascots, and theme tunes were reproduced. The game was released on the Oric 1, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro and Commodore 64. The gameplay is similar to the video game BurgerTime.[1] 
 
Gameplay[edit] 
At the start of the game, Mr. Wimpy has to cross his kitchen while avoiding moving manholes to get to the larder so that he can collect ingredients and make his burgers. As an added hazard, a character called Waldo tries and steal these ingredients from him.[2] After the opening level, the game becomes a traditional platform game where the player must guide Mr. Wimpy across the platforms while walking over four various burger ingredients, which in turn causes them to crash to the platform below and finally to the four plates at the bottom.[2] Mr. Wimpy must also avoid various enemies in the guise of walking sausages, eggs, pickles, and spoons. Players have the ability to spray pepper at the enemies, which temporarily freezes them for a few seconds, allowing players to escape.[2] Enemies can also be trapped and squashed by walking over burger ingredients while they are on the level below.[3] 
 
The platform portion of the game features the following enemies: Sid Sos (a walking sausage), Ogy Egg (a walking fried egg), Sam Spoon (a walking spoon), and Pam Pickle (a walking pickle).[3] As the player progresses in the game, more enemies are added.[citation needed] Mr. Wimpy's only defences against the enemies are to either trap them between the falling burger ingredients or to temporarily freeze them with pepper.[citation needed] However, players can only a small supply of pepper at any given time (4 bottles could be carried).[2] Players can pick up coffee cups or ice creams that appear on the screen (when they are down to their last pepper pot), rewarding them with an extra pepper pot.[2] Players are given four lives at the start of the game, any of which can be lost in the opening Larder level by falling down a moving pothole or by getting caught by an enemy in the platform portion of the game.[citation needed]",[268435464],,2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.igdb.com/games/mr-wimpy,,b3711ba6-8411-b0d7-d326-5eb4cb4e3065,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quartet begins with four separate stories, playable in any order. Those stories come together, giving the player a final party of eight characters. In combat, the player can deploy four of those characters at a time, with the ability to quickly swap in any of the four “reserve” characters. When a character swaps in, they immediately take their turn. While characters are in the reserves, they regenerate their AP at an enhanced rate.

It was a short nuclear war of just a few hours. It is not known who started it and why. Probably it was decided randomly. Perhaps it was a human or computer error. All those who would know are dead. 
 
After the first rocket attack, everything happened so fast. Retaliatory strikes were launched one after the other with only a few minutes intervals. On that day, millions of people died and the largest cities were razed to the ground. Those who survived had to face the world, which with each passing hour and day plunged into increasing chaos ... 
However, This Was Just the Beginning. 
 
The vast majority of weapons that belong to the arsenal of ""The Last Day Weapons"" were not used for some unknown reason. Created to deter and not to be used, powerful enough to end life on our planet. 
 
After the war, which caused command centers to be destroyed and governments to cease to exist, this weapon remained without any control. One of the most dangerous units of this arsenal is the Arizona-12 secret submarine. 
 
Who will take control over it and what will it be used for?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hire Screen
Your team can get injured, get mentally stressed or ill, they can act erratically with other team members, they can lose their skills over time, and most importantly they can save the city. But it's up to you to manage which one can happen at any given time. Your team must gather Intel which can prevent terror attacks on and around the city, and allow you to send yourself or your team out on missions to diffuse bombs or arrest suspicious individuals in order to eradicate  the terrorist cell, Fraction, from the city.

Who Are Fraction?
 

Fraction is a terrorist cell whose base of operation is somewhere within the city you reside over. They are made up of teams of hackers, bomb makers, and general anarchists whom have all come to the conclusion that in order to resolve issues of inequality and overpopulation, a vast majority of the population must be eradicated in order for humanity to continue at a diminished rate.

They see no other alternative, and while they originally set out to disrupt the accumulation of wealth for the richest 1%, they have slowly changed their doctrine to encumber more extremist measures, killing indiscriminately in order to incite fear and ultimately reduce the population down to a fraction of what it once was.

Finding Fraction and Their Threats:

As your team gather Intel, you'll be able to pinpoint locations of interest, such as where Fractions Members meet, where they assemble bombs, and most immediately pressing, where they have planted a bomb.

A Single District of the Map
The map consists of many districts, each with their own attributes, landmarks, municipals buildings, functions, and classes. This determines whether or not they are likely to be under immediate threat by Fraction, as the terrorist cell adopts a different tactic every other week to disrupt your operations, and eliminate human life.

For instance, as Fraction was founded upon disrupting the lives of the socially elite, they may initially still target richer districts at first. However, their tactics have grown so indiscriminate over time, that no where is safe.

Story Building:

In ""Don't Go Bang!"" concerned citizens and members of UOD will email you regularly about the state of the city, and the state of your management skills. This is the primary way you directly build relationships in the game, with each email having multiple responses to cater to your own style of management, and your own intentions for how your relationship develops with that person. There is no ""Just Good"" or ""Just Bad"" answer. We want to embrace the grey area of dealing with a complex and frightening scenario.

Email System
As you build relationships, the content of each email differs as every person remembers who you are and what you've said. Choose to be unkind because you don't have the time, and it might come back to bite you later. Equally, be too soft and people might find it acceptable to walk all over you. Remember, YOU are in charge.

Ultimately, you are responsible for the protection of the city. As such, if you continue to fail on a regular basis, you will be petitioned to be replaced by the citizens of the city, as they work themselves into a panic and a frenzy. They will make life continually more difficult for you. If they succeed in having you removed from office, the game, and the city, is lost.

Do not fail them. Do not fail your loved ones. Do not let Fraction win.



Current Features: (In The Mobile Game)

Procedural Bomb Generation
Wire Cutting Puzzle Variations (Cut All Yellow Wires, Cut Third Wires etc.)
Multiple Tiers Per Bomb (Multiple Levels/Sections to each bomb.)
Planned Features: (For The PC Game)

Massively improved visuals - We'll be able to hire an artist better than ourselves to give the games art a complete overhaul to capture the intensity of the situation, whilst still capturing the games dark humour moments too.
Panic - The purpose of the game is to respond to terrorist threats, suspected/potential/otherwise. Failure to do so will result in increased panic in the city, and as this grows the citizens can petition to have your funds lowered, or to have you removed completely, resulting in Game Over.
Complex Bomb Disposal - With the limitation of a single tap used in mobile games being lifted, we can make the bomb disposal process much more complex and interesting. This includes requiring certain tools to perform certain actions.
Rules/Instructions - The rules of bomb disposal will change depending on how quickly Fraction is improving their bomb making skills. It's upto your team to gather Intel to give you the new list of instructions as quickly as possible. E.g. You may be told to always cut the first red wire, and then one day that rules changes...
Full Map - A huge interactive Map with different districts that have different functions for the city. As events/festivals/celebrations come up, the population density of an area may change, and you'll have to work harder to protect these areas.
Manage and Build your team - Hire people you trust and build them up to be the best they can be at bomb disposal. You cannot afford to use them sparingly, but be careful as once they're dead, they stay dead.
Connection to the Citizens - You receive regular emails and communications from concerned or supportive citizens in the city regarding the recent events. You can make dialogue decisions on how well you should inform the public or build relationships with people. Be careful though, as you fail missions, those you care about can perish.
Shop - You are able to customise your office space that you work in, as well as buy new equipment for yourself and your crew.
Research - As Fraction grows, and their bomb making prowess increases, it’s your job to stay one step ahead, so you’d have to recruit avid researchers to provide you with the latest tools and equipment to deal with the threats.
Scanner/Send Investigation Team – As briefly mentioned, the map displays information about the city currently, but in order to find bombs there has to be a process to do so. You can do this by scanning for suspicious signals, or physically sending an investigation team (at your expense) to reconnoitre the area and report back if there are threats or potential threats.


Breakdown of Funds for Don't Go Bang!
Part of our commitment to being open and honest regarding everything about this endeavour means going over exactly where your pledges will be going towards. On our part, we've designed the game for a long time, and came up with exactly what it is and could be back when it was a mobile game, and what it is now! 
As such, you might be wondering while Design gets less of a cut than Art and Programming, but the truth is we did a lot of the Design work off our own funds, but it still needs Playtesting which comes under Design, and also various tweaks - a lot of the time a Programmer makes it work, but a Designer makes it feel right. Equally, while the Writing Budget is low, it's because this also comes under Design at times, so it's actually difficult to pinpoint.


 We'll be humbled immensely if we reach our goal of £20,000, but if the unimaginable were to happen and we go beyond that, we've carefully selected a number of stretch goals to help make ""Don't Go Bang!"" an even better experience.


Stretch Goals for Don't Go Bang!
Either way, we'll strive to make ""Don't Go Bang!"" an amazing experience, with incredible gameplay and an engaging, unforgettable story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks to a series of options it's possible to make the game more faithful to the real thing or easier and more accessible, based on one's preferences. After selecting the preferred riding style between Basic, Arcade, Advanced, Simulation and Extreme, it's possible to adapt the game to each own needs: braking assistance, power braking, front and rear braking at once or separate control, traction control, advanced physics, off track stability control, rider's health, bike damages, tire wear, starting help, automatic transmission, rider position control, official rules, warm up lap, false start penalty, ideal trajectory, riding help. 
 
When selecting the Simulation riding model there are many things that need to be taken into consideration: tires wear down, brakes can wear down, the bike can be damaged and the rider can be injured when an accident occurs. It's therefore important to find the best setup for the bike changing suspension setup, handling geometry, braking, chainring length, gear ratio and tire type.","[268435466, 536870969]",,2021-11-11 20:28:07,https://www.igdb.com/games/sbk-09-superbike-world-championship--1,"[107261, 107269]",6deb8268-9fc1-d7e7-1ca9-6b4a3b4d5240,[4144],"[16990, 16991]","[24656, 24657, 24658, 24666]",,,85.0,2.0,72.5,3.0,,[57],,,,4303.0,,,,,,1.0,,60.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,

Gameplay is a cross between real time combat and strategy, with characters representing one of the five colors. White had healing and soldiers; Blue countermagic and water creatures; Black death and undead creatures; Red fire and mountain creatures; and Green elves and forest magic.

You and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.'s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you've got to take the fight to the streets.

Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. 
If your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double whammy slams.

The Tomb of Sargeras has been reopened, and the demons of the Burning Legion pour into our world. Their full, terrifying might is fixed on summoning the Dark Titan to Azeroth-and they've already located the key to his return.
With the Alliance and Horde devastated, adventurers must take up legendary artifacts and weapons used by the heroes of old, scour the ancient Broken Isles for relics of the Titans, and challenge the Burning Legion before Azeroth's last hope dies.
Steel yourself, champion. Extinction is imminent.
Following the events of Warlords of Draenor, the alternate Draenor's Gul'dan is expelled by his demonic masters into the original Azeroth with a special purpose - to reopen the Tomb of Sargeras and the gateway to Argus, commencing the third invasion of the Burning Legion, an invasion even greater than the War of the Ancients. Gul'dan also had to find and steal the body of the famous demon hunter Illidan Stormrage.

After the defeat at the Broken Shore, the defenders of Azeroth found themselves exploring the long-forgotten Broken Isles in search of the Pillars of Creation, titan relics which were used to shape the world - and which were Azeroth's only hope for closing the massive demonic portal at the heart of the Tomb. However, the Broken Isles - a land which 10,000 years ago was home to the then mighty night elf civilization - came with their own perils to overcome, from the demon lord Xavius and his satyr armies, to the vrykul's God-King Skovald, to the powerful nightborne night elves, and the deadly naga led by Tidemistress Athissa.

As part of this desperate search, the Kirin Tor, now led by Khadgar, moved the floating city of Dalaran to the shores of this land, with the city serving as a central hub for the efforts of the world's heroes. The death knights of Acherus also took their floating necropolis to the Isles.

To defend their world against the onslaught of the Legion, the heroes of Azeroth sought out legendary artifact weapons to wield in battle, but also found themselves embracing new and unexpected allies in the form of the Illidari, Illidan's elite disciples, freed in desperation by the Wardens that guarded them to fight against the Legion in this hour of need.

Ongoing conflict between the Alliance and the Horde led to the formation of the class orders, with exceptional commanders putting aside faction to lead their classes in the fight against the Legion.",,,7.0,[135],52.0,,87.0833333333333,15.0,,,,,,,,,

Season progress can be resumed through passwords or via memory card, which offers you a choice between a regular or advanced memory card season. Regular means you can trade and create players, but the trades will be automatic and the created players always appear on your team.

Of course you have to dig deep into the underground to find them. Your responsibility lies in the building. managing and defending of mines. To achieve this you hire employees with different professions: Craftsmen, researchers, mine workers, hauliers and warriors. These people want to see money for their work and they improve their abilities when they become experienced. 
 
During the game you dig new alleys, equip them with traps, research new tools and fight against enemy troops to conquer their alleys. Later you have mutated creatures to your disposal. You spend most of your time on a map with hexagonal fields. There you issue orders and set the routes of your employees.

The game is played with a controller with one turn table and 5 keys, three white and two black. On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch. 
 
Even though the game is based on the beatmania 3rdMIX engine, it does not feature a combo count. It is the first game in the series to show song titles on the song select and not just the genres. The flashing great judgement is introduced, which requires better precision to obtain over the normal great judgement. 
 
INTERNET RANKING functionality is implemented. After a course has been completed an INTERNET RANKING code was given, which could be entered on Konamis online leaderboards.

Once filled with masterful works of art, such as Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring, Edvard Munch’s The Scream, and Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks, the Château du Voleur – which translates to Thief’s Castle – lost all paintings and sculptures due to a band of thieves that broke in during a torrential storm. That fateful night was August 9, 1793. 
 
Over 200 years later, all the stolen works of art have since been found by authorities and returned to their current museums and galleries. The once-noble and grand château held the group of thieves within its dungeon. Now, the castle has been abandoned as the spirits of those thieves roam the halls. 
 
Your task is to enter the château, build up your bank account, and collect all the works of art that originally adorned the castle walls for a special art exhibition.

July 2156.

Sandra had been out of the room where she worked for three weeks straight, on the east coast of New Zealand. She was focused on his research into a new genomic model for species adapted to environments that could be susceptible to exist on Earth, within the period of five hundred to a billion years. Her genetic research on adaptability of life to the environment, and her conclusions, were definitely unreliable. She would have to look for better alternatives. The most promising thing she had was focusing on birds, no doubt. Adapting some of them combining their DNA with that of other species promised to give more hopeful results.

She was absorbed in these thoughts when a signal sounded. It was an incoming call. She accepted it. The number was known. And unexpected. But somehow she felt the need to know what that was about.

“Well, if it’s Jan, my personal admirer.”
“Hi Sandra how are you. I have not heard from you in a while.”
“I’m dressed this time, for your misfortune.”
“That fixes easily. There are Irenka and the children. You could undress again. I liked the show.”
“Not in your best dreams.” He laughed. She added:
“How is Irenka?” And the children?”
“Irenka is getting prettier every day. And the children ask me about you.” Sandra sighed.
“I cannot go all I want, Jan. You can come home, taking the necessary precautions. Bring the children. But I cannot go, I can´t do that. You know, if they find me, if they know I’m an android …
“I know. But it is not fair. Together we have worked very well these years.”
“That explains it to the G.S.A. They continue with their android control campaign. You already know his motto: “Men will never be slaves. Androids will never stop being “.
“Something happened to you three years ago. Something you do not want to tell me. “Sandra nodded slightly.
“That’s right, Jan. I do not want to tell you.” Jan insisted,
“What happened to you up there, Sandra?” You’ve been very changed ever since. You got me worried. Irenka feels the same.”
“I could tell you. But then I would have to kill you.”
“You are very funny.” Jan never knew that, actually, it was not a joke. Sandra continued:
“Well, I imagine it’s not a courtesy call.” It’s another of your “jobs”. Jan nodded.
“It is. We sent one of our operatives to Saturn’s moon Titan as part of the Gamma team for the math competition at the Titan Deep Space Company. I had to do … a job.” Sandra’s face twisted.
“What? That madness? That’s not a sport, Jan! It’s a monstrosity!
“But you know the money you make in bets. And all that this entails: it is white, selling arms and drugs, and other things.
“I know too well. And the company, I prefer not to speak.”
“Why? The Titan Deep Space Company malfunctioned for a while, until its former chief executive Richard Tsakalidis regained control. Do you know him?”
“I´ve read something” Sandra lied. “But let’s focus. Are you asking me by chance to go to Titan? That fucking space station where that stupid math tournament is held? That “Math Combat Challenge”?
“Exactly. Our agent has disappeared. The last contact was three days ago. No one has seen him since. He had to send us data about a group of white traffickers and traffickers who organized the gambling business at the company’s space station. We’ve been behind them for two years. We wanted to gather conclusive evidence during the maths championship.”
“That’s not a math championship, Jan. That’s a massacre.
“Well, there’s math during the tournament.”
“Do not be sarcastic.
“I’m not! Listen, I know I owe you more than one favor.”
“And more than three.”
“I know. Will you help me? I’ll give you whatever you want in return.” Sandra hesitated for a moment.
“Anything?”
“Of course.”
“A weekend with the children on excursion. They and I alone.” Jan opened his eyes.
“What? That’s not a request! That’s a blessing!”
“And you take Irenka to some pretty place. You have abandoned her for your work.”
“Sandra, we’ve already talked about it.”
“Shut up. You will do it?”
“Agree. I will make the sacrifice of leaving the children with Aunt Sandra for a weekend.”
“It’s okay. I’ll be right out. Give me all the facts of the case.”
“Be careful, Sandra, please. They say that that area, the deep space beyond Jupiter, is crazy. Trade routes are taken by pirates, and security sold to the highest bidder. Every news is worse than the last.”
“Look who’s talking.”Because of you, I have almost blown my head twice.”
“But you’ve always managed to get through it.”
“The shots do. To hold you is another matter. Goodbye, Jan. And remember the covenant.”

Sandra took the first ship to Titan. On this occasion she did not stop at Mars, because the planet was in opposition to Saturn. She was glad of it. Sh didn’t want to remember the events that happened on the planet three years ago. There began a nightmare of which she would not want to remember anything. But her programming prevented her from hiding memories. It was part of her design. In this way the android obtained an experience, positive sometimes, negative others, and could not remain alone with the good, which gave more character to the artificial personality.

She felt some anxiety about that trip. All the anguish that can feel an android of infiltration and combat model QCS-60 advanced. Her quantum computer had ceased to be what it had been originally long ago, when she intervened in the unfortunate Operation Folkvangr. The accumulation of experiences, and the many events lived in the last hundred and seven years, had transformed her radically. And back to Titan, where she had been about to die three years ago, during that crisis with that damn ship, they had finished modeling her with a new personality. Harder, colder, but also more stable. In many respects, very little remained of the original android. Maybe nothing.

The transport left her on Titan, the satellite of Saturn that was an almost inexhaustible source of hydrocarbons for the solar system, and which exploited exclusively the Titan Deep Space Company. Sandra stayed in a hotel not far from the base where three years before she was first leader and then prisoner. The hotel had a shuttle to the space station where the sports competition known as the “Math Combat Challenge” was held. That barbarity was the favorite sport of the solar system. It was basically a huge stadium on a huge space station where participants had to solve various math problems of all kinds. Gigantic virtual panels showed various mathematical exercises, and participants had to find the right numbers moving through the stadium, or shoot the solution if it was in a group of possible answers.

The peculiarity of this sport was, however, very peculiar: it was based on the fact that these exercises had to be solved in the midst of countless traps that were happening in the stadium, in addition to an endless chain of attacks of all kinds of elements. Only occasional help was available for a bird-shaped dron. Beyond that, the motto of the competition was: to count and to survive. The winners made a fortune. Losers lost everything, including, of course, life. They could retire before they perished. But few did.

Titan Deep Space Company sponsored the game, with which it made even more money than its industry, and also allowed it to launder some of the profits made in ways not too neat. The president of the company, Richard Tsakalidis, had disappeared three years ago, during the crisis that Sandra suffered on Titan, only to appear by surprise a year later, seemingly without remembering anything of the happened thing, and taking back its position. The Board of Directors immediately readmitted him, for many and varied reasons that it was better not to remember.

Sandra settled into her room, after rejecting a couple of proposals she had had from a couple of men who had invited her into her room without even inviting her to a previous drink, something too common in her daily life. It was put in underwear with slippers, and activated the holographic emitter of sports, where they were emitted images of the competition. It was at that moment that the image of the projector was transformed. Then came a figure that was clear and bitterly recognized.

“Richard!” How?…
-Hello Sandra. Glad to see you in good condition. As beautiful as always. Those blue eyes are awesome. And that set you up very well.
“Where were you?” And where is Scott? Is he still kidnapped?
“You’ve always asked too many questions.” Let’s say Scott is now a valuable and effective partner. And let’s say that I continue with my firm and clear objectives, but that you already know. What I want to know is what you’re doing here.
“That’s none of your business, Richard. Or Zeus, as you like to be called.
-I did not like it, but in the end it’s looking good, I even added the image of Zeus to the company’s new logo. You must know that everything that happens on Titan is my business. I saw that you bought an entry for the Math Combat Challenge. Do you want me to get you a front row seat? Or are you going to participate as a math fighter?
“Go to hell, Richard.”
“Oh yeah. Hell, people send me there with some frequency. In any case, I’ll be watching you, Sandra. After what happened between us, I have a deep wound in my heart. You hurt me. I, I gave it all for you. I offered you an empire. And you paid for it by betraying me.
“You’ll have a good wound in the heart when I tear it to pieces, you pig.”
“I’m sorry, Sandra. You take this too personally, especially considering that you are nothing but a pile of scrap metal. All this is business. Simple business. And, in these businesses, you’re either with me, or you’re against me. And you are in the second group. It boils down to that. In any case, I’ll finish by finding out what brought you here. I assure.
“How did you find me so fast?”

There was no answer. The image was cut. At that moment the door sounded. Not with the bell, but with the classic knuckle touch. Sandra sighed wondering who it would be. She opened the door. On the other side of the door appeared a man of about forty years and a cloudy look. He stood erect and silent. Sandra asked:
“Who are you?”
“Jan sent you here, to look for an operative from her investigating agency that has disappeared, didn’t´he?” Sandra felt the world fall on her. First Richard discovered it when he arrived. Now that man knew perfectly well why he was there. She answered:
“How do you know that?”
“Very easy, Sandra. It turns out that I am that operative …",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heller is briefed on the previous outbreaks in Idaho in the '60s and in NYZ in the events of the first game. He later finds Mercer and begins chasing him. 
 
Pursuing Mercer for vengeance, Heller is infected by Mercer with a strain that imbues him with similar superhuman abilities. After blacking out, Heller awakens in a Yellow Zone lab where Gentek scientist Dr. Anton Koenig and Blackwatch Col. Douglas Rooks are experimenting on him. Heller escapes from the Gentek base, when Mercer confronts him and claims Gentek and Blackwatch are responsible for recreating and cultivating the Blacklight virus, making them responsible for the second infection and the deaths of Heller's family. Revealing his plans to take down Gentek and Blackwatch, Mercer offers a truce to Heller. Unsure of Mercer's intentions Heller goes to his local pastor, Father Luis Guerra, for advice and help. 
 
Using information supplied by Guerra, Heller hacks into Blacknet Terminals to find out about and sabotage a number of their operations. Gradually consuming his way through Blackwatch, Heller eventually finds and confronts Koenig, who claims to be on his side and reveals Blackwatch's super-soldier program, codenamed ""Orion"". Heller prevents Project: Orion's progress by killing a super-soldier who was injected with his DNA. After consuming one of the head scientists, Heller discovers that Koenig was observing him in order to find his weaknesses. Enraged at Koenig's betrayal, Heller tracks him down only to discover that he has powers similar to he and Mercer, and is one of several ""Evolved"" agents planted in Gentek and Blackwatch by Mercer. After defeating and consuming the doctor, Mercer reveals to Heller that he intends to recruit him in an attempt to control NYZ. His doubts growing, Guerra then shows Heller a video tape of Mercer releasing the virus for the second time in Penn Station, the same place Mercer originally released and contracted the virus. 
 
Enraged at Mercer's deception, Heller sets off to the Green Zone to hunt down Mercer's henchmen, including an Evolved agent in Gentek named Sabrina Galloway; upon confronting Galloway, however, Heller reluctantly teams up with her when she reveals she can help him take down Mercer. With Galloway's help, Heller soon finds that Mercer plans to infect the entire world through ""Whitelight"", a contaminated vaccine released by Gentek that actually serves to accelerate infection and evolution rather than prevent it. 
 
Frustrated with Heller sabotaging his plans, Mercer kills Father Guerra; upon finding his corpse, however, a grieving Heller uses Guerra's phone to reach Athena, Guerra's contact who is revealed to be Dana Mercer. Dana explains that Heller's daughter, Maya, is still alive, prompting Heller to head for the Red Zone to take down Mercer and save Maya. After preventing Blackwatch's second attempt to level Manhattan Island, Rooks helps Heller reach his daughter, only for Galloway to betray him and take Maya to Mercer. Upon confronting Mercer, he reveals that he plans to solve international conflicts and world problems by infecting the entire human race, effectively creating a Superorganism with Maya at the center. After Mercer absorbs Galloway and the remaining Evolved, the two engage in a bloody duel, only for James to emerge victorious and to kill and consume Mercer. 
 
Subsequently, Heller wipes out the infected in NYZ along with most of the Blacklight Virus; then using Mercer's absorbed memories, Heller locates and frees Maya and Dana from a vault. The story then ends with the three overlooking New York before Dana questions what to do next.",,,,,53.0,,77.1,12.0,,,[19611],,,,,,

The party is back and bigger than ever in the Mario Party™ 9 game for Wii, featuring all-new ways to play! For the first time in the franchise, boss battles crash the party and challenge players to compete to defeat a common enemy. In addition, players now travel across stages together in a vehicle towards a common goal - overcoming obstacles, battling bosses, and collecting Mini Stars stolen by Bowser™ and his minions. Featuring 80 new minigames, adventurous new stages, and all-new ways to play that blend cooperative and competitive action for up to four players*, Mario Party 9 is the perfect way to get the party started.

-For the first time in the Mario Party franchise, each stage culminates in a Boss Battle. Collectively, players must combine their strength to defeat classic foes such as Bowser™ and King Boo while still playing competitively to boost their own individual scores.

-In another first for the series, players ride across stages together in special vehicles. Players take turns as Captain of the vehicle by hitting Dice Blocks to move the party forward, hoping to land on lucky spaces. The vehicles also help to streamline game play and keep everyone involved in the action.

-Unique Captain Events on each stage give players a new way to change the shape of the game.

-In Mario Party 9, each themed stage has a clear destination point but with multiple paths along the way, so no two games will play the same. From Toad Road to Boo’s Horror Castle, players will encounter a wide variety of familiar Mario franchise elements in new environments that can be enjoyed solo or with friends.

-Includes 80 outrageous new minigames that find players making pizzas, escaping haunted mansions, and racing snowmobiles.

-No time to play through an entire stage? New minigame modes let players enjoy the action in smaller chunks of time. They can hone their skills at any minigame in Free Play mode or try the Extras mode that includes Goomba Bowling and the puzzle-based Castle Clearout.

-Every time they play, players can earn Party Points that are used to unlock special items and features.

* Additional accessories are required for multiplayer game play and are sold separately.","[40, 268435465, 268435487, 268435491, 536871106, 536871186, 536872273, 536873024, 536873064, 536873186, 536875130, 536875240, 536875350, 536875391, 536875392, 536875590, 536875819, 536875924, 536876856, 536876927, 536877050, 536877051, 536877052, 536877055, 536877065, 536877066, 536877068, 536877069, 536877071, 536877090, 536877104, 536877106, 536877543, 536878155, 536878159, 536879098, 536879791, 536880863, 536882821]",[40],2022-03-03 11:56:59,https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-party-9,"[11798, 11799, 11800]",e2c13519-1ec1-c6cf-838d-79da74624bbc,"[10789, 47125, 47126]","[43985, 43986]",[8096],,,67.8415567006189,34.0,70.7541116836428,37.0,,"[194, 274, 1361, 2112, 2152, 2274, 4218, 4328, 4438, 4479, 4480, 4678, 4907, 5012, 5944, 6015, 6138, 6139, 6140, 6143, 6153, 6154, 6156, 6157, 6159, 6178, 6192, 6194, 6631, 7243, 7247, 8186, 8879, 9951, 11909]",[2],"[4501, 4502]","[11898, 11899]",453.0,,,,,"[24, 845]",8.0,24.0,73.6666666666667,3.0,[17195],,,,,,,,

Key features
Changing gravity
Have you ever wanted to walk on ceiling? Well now you can!
Bullet hell
All the bullet are physics based (no hitscan) so you can dodge most of the bullets (with a bit of skill)
Bullet time
Just somewhat standard slowing down of time. Really helps with dodging bullets and also shooting down enemies while in air. Are you asking why would anyone do that - because it's cool!
Melee
Because sometimes you just want to punch someone in face with mace (or sword or axe).
Dashing
Skip short distance frontward. Help with platforming. Also good to get out of hard to handle fighting situations.
Bossfights
More enjoyable to fight with than your common foe.","[1, 268435461, 268435488, 268435489]",[1],2022-02-15 13:50:08,https://www.igdb.com/games/project-gravity,"[155525, 155526, 155527, 155528]",31570410-a84c-2686-4390-643abc04082c,,[109807],,,,,,,,[13],,[1],[20831],[41368],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One day, two spirits known as Dove and Raven chose to help the humans, and gave one of them the power to transform into a spirit himself. This human was known as the Arbiter, and his job was to defeat and seal more dangerous spirits within himself. As a result, the war ended, and the spirits stopped their fighting in fear of being sealed for all eternity... except for some.

The Greater Spirits were much more intelligent, powerful spirits, and they did not fear the Arbiter's judgement. Their increased power made it much harder for the Arbiter to keep them sealed within his body. As a result, he had to pass down his powers to a successor as he grew older and weak. This went on for six generations until the most recent Arbiter was killed by a spirit known only as The Grey.

With the last Arbiter's death, the spirits sealed by the Arbiters of the past were released back into the world, free to cause havoc once again. In his final moments, the Arbiter passed his powers onto his successor and apprentice, Ashe, a boy now faced with an impossible task.

With the help of Dove and Raven, Ashe must now hunt the Greater Spirits that were released and seal them once more, restoring peace to humanity. But throughout his travels, he may find that the world isn't quite as black and white as it seems...""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sakura Samurai: Art of the Sword is about precision swordplay, battlefield finesse, and martial-arts style.

As the heroic title character, you’ll travel a world rife with cherry-blossom beauty—and deadly danger—to rescue the legendary Princess Cherry Blossom. Her kidnapper has set dozens of blade-wielding henchmen in your path, and you’ll have to exercise your best battle senses to defeat them and save her. Learn to predict your foes’ moves, deftly dodge their attacks, and create opportunities for devastating counterattacks.

Start with the Sakura Sword, a little health, and some basic training from your water-spirit guide. Make your way from battleground to battleground fighting wave after wave of increasingly cunning enemies. Fight through huge castles to duel epic bosses. And don’t forget to stop at small villages along the way to get help, gear, encouragement (and distraction) from the quirky townsfolk.

DEVELOPMENT HISTORY 
Marketing specifically requested a children's educational game for the Intellivoice. Programmer Ron Surratt (Atari 2600 BurgerTime) and graphic artist Peggi Decarli (USCF Chess) drew up some initial concepts for the game (Ron's input was requested because he used to be a teacher), then Steve Ettinger was assigned as programmer. New-hire Joe Ferreira was added to train with Peggi as a graphics artist. Steve and Joe quickly became a strong design team, taking the concept from a barnyard to a carousel and making the game their own. By the time it was finished, however, Marketing decided that sales of Intellivoice units were too low to support such a ""specialty"" cartridge. Magic Carousel was shelved with the hope that a future increase in Intellivoice sales would justify the game's release. It never happened. 
 
Steve and Joe had proved themselves to be a formidable team, so they were chosen to design the top-secret experimental Intellivision game, Hover Force 3-D.

The northern regions controlled the underground rivers that supplied water to the entire continent, but the southern lands were punished by drought and heat. This was the main reason for their struggle, but in the end, the beliefs of its inhabitants became stronger than thirst.

Feros was then divided, and those who agreed to keep investigating Synchrony, crossed the natural border of Bismut pass to the north, land of rivers and mountains. At that time, in the south began a cult for the drivos, dangerous creatures able to spit destructive flares. The fanatics called themselves the Drivanian and founded Salaber in the south.

Synchrony was branded as heresy from the cult and tensions began. Those who studied it were called adepts, but to their disgrace many of them were killed by the Salaber army. The tensions grew so much that the war broke out across the continent, destroying cities in its path that only remain in the memory and written history of Feros.

It is 570, the war of fire and water has continued its course, but months ago, Salaber released a powerful weapon from the top of the Bismut pass which almost destroyed the entire continent with its titanic rain of fire. Now, the ashes of war that are still burning are trying to be revived and extinguished alike.

Shinn, the capital of Barfa Rali in the north, sends Galina Angstroud as an agent to discover the truth about the rumors of a new use of that terrible weapon.

The most significant difference is that it features none of the original levels, since the eight worlds are all unique to this release and have a high level of difficulty surpassing even Super Mario Bros. 2.","[1, 268435464, 536872961, 536873024, 536873064, 536874834, 536875056, 536875131, 536875213, 536875286, 536875391, 536875392, 536875792, 536876357, 536877084, 536877086, 536877088, 536877091, 536877093, 536877277, 536877710, 536878217, 536879691, 536879791, 536880106, 536880107, 536880110, 536884432]",[1],2021-10-06 15:34:58,https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-bros-special,"[141993, 141994]",887fe1fa-f619-12ba-daf1-fadba05b702a,,"[97373, 100175, 100176]","[31821, 31822]",,,,,,,,"[2049, 2112, 2152, 3922, 4144, 4219, 4301, 4374, 4479, 4480, 4880, 5445, 6172, 6174, 6176, 6179, 6181, 6365, 6798, 7305, 8779, 8879, 9194, 9195, 9198, 13520]",[4],,[35306],6118.0,,,,,[845],,,,,,,,,,,,,

But because of the dark thoughts in people's minds, the Nightmare was born and threatened to end the world. A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world.

Years later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people's dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other's goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together.

In Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the seven keys. Each dream is different as each person is different, which means that the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems - even the boss is a giant money bag.

Within the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack.

In order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve. For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch. If you run into any problems, you can always talk to Tumble or the Dream Sheep for hints and help.","[1, 268435487, 536871138, 536871213, 536871301, 536871889, 536871938, 536871939, 536873082, 536874398, 536874745, 536875073, 536875298, 536875309, 536875488, 536875621, 536875689, 536875695, 536875803, 536875944, 536876266, 536876353, 536876504, 536876847, 536877049, 536877494, 536877628]",[1],2021-09-12 20:42:40,https://www.igdb.com/games/dual-hearts,[223864],50582ef9-ebd5-7829-142c-09c7cc370b9b,[18708],,[73320],,,,,,,,"[226, 301, 389, 977, 1026, 1027, 2170, 3486, 3833, 4161, 4386, 4397, 4576, 4709, 4777, 4783, 4891, 5032, 5354, 5441, 5592, 5935, 6137, 6582, 6716]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything changes, however, one day on the roof, when the class oddball, Aoi, suddenly tries to kiss him. Miyuki appears just in time to stop her, but afterward, Shinichi feels the urge to bring some light to this friendless girl's eyes. He enlists Miyuki's aid, and thus, a trio is born.

Unfortunately, a zombie outbreak has occurred, which leads to Juliet fighting off hordes of Undead on her way to meet Nick. When she arrives, she discovers Nick fighting off a zombie which was trying to eat her, and so Nick is bitten in her place. Realizing he will become a zombie, Juliet decides she must decapitate him to save him.
When he comes to, Nick discovers he is somehow still alive, despite being a severed head, and so Juliet reveals to him that she is a zombie hunter, and that she performed a magical ritual on him which keeps his soul from being turned into a zombie and retaining his humanity, thus explaining his continued existence as a severed head. Juliet attaches Nick's head to her belt, and she fights hordes of zombies on her way to meet her tutor, Morikawa (voiced by Bruce Locke in English and Bin Shimada in Japanese). Once they are united, Morikawa explains the situation, and explains that the Universe is divided into three realms: Earth, the Land Beyond Words, and the Rotten World, an infernal realm where demons and zombies reside.[7] Morikawa tells Juliet and Nick that somebody has cracked open a portal between Earth and the Rotten World by a combination of black magic and explosives, and Morikawa sets out to find the culprit. Juliet reunites again with Morikawa after fighting zombies intent on blowing her to oblivion, and finds the person responsible for the outbreak, an evil goth named Swan (voiced by Sean Gunn in English and Nobuhiko Okamoto in Japanese) but she cannot prevent him from summoning five demons to the world, which take the form of zombies centered on themes of rock and roll.[8] Morikawa attempts to stop Swan from unleashing the demons, but he is mortally wounded.
Swan sends the first zombie overlord, Zed (voiced by Jimmy Urine in English and Shintaro Asanuma in Japanese), after her, but she kills him in a fight and sends him back to the Rotten World. Morikawa tells her to purify the school and kill the four remaining zombie overlords before dying. Juliet hunts down the overlords, while receiving advice from her sisters Cordelia Starling (voiced by Linda Cardellini in English and Mayumi Asano in Japanese), the elder one, and Rosalind Starling (voiced by Kimberly Brooks in English and Mariya Ise in Japanese), the younger sister.[9] Juliet continues exploring the school and fighting zombies, and encounters Vikke, the second zombie overlord summoned by Swan, whom she duels onboard his airborne longship and sends him back to Rotten World. The longship crashes into the O'Bannon Farm. Juliet is attacked mentally by nightmares projected from Mariska, the zombie Queen of Psychedelia, but Juliet eventually shakes off the nightmares and faces Mariska herself, defeating her and sending her back to Rotten World. Juliet's father, Gideon, arrives and takes her back to the city, where Juliet, Nick and Gideon infiltrate the Fulci Fun Center upon realizing it is full of gamer zombies. Josey, the zombie overlord in charge of the center, summons Juliet to his lair atop the building, and in a duel, Juliet also defeats him. Finally with one zombie overlord left, Juliet's family all team up to infiltrate an unfinished Cathedral in the heart of the city, where the final overlord, Lewis Legend, lurks. Upon accessing his lair, Swan taunts Juliet about Lewis being more than a match for her; ultimately, though, the situation is reversed. Just like all the other overlords upon their deaths, Lewis utters a Latin chant.
Swan appears and applauds Juliet for her work and reveals the cruel fact that she was a pawn in his game, and he allowed all the zombie overlords to die so the true zombie lord could be returned to this world. Swan also tells Juliet that it was she, and all the other students at the school, that made him into a monster through torture and bullying. (However, the flashbacks shown imply that Swan might have had feelings for Juliet and that her relationship with Nick pushed him further over the edge.) Essentially, the zombie outbreak was his act of vengeance against the school's students, and society in general for making him an outcast. Juliet tries to reason with him, but Swan, indifferent towards any attempt to get him to see the error of his ways, shoots his head off to finish the ritual and is absorbed along with the rest of the Undead into a black vortex, which solidifies into the zombie of all zombies: Killabilly, whom Juliet is forced to fight.
Juliet battles Killabilly and is contacted by the ghost of Morikawa, who gives her advice along with Nick. Halfway through the fight, Gideon drives his motorcycle packed with explosives into the maw of Killabilly, and is seemingly destroyed. Juliet mourns her father, but Nick and Morikawa encourage her to enter the mouth of Killabilly before he regenerates. Juliet complies and lands in the demon's stomach, where, in his heart, she encounters Swan's headless corpse. She learns she must put Nick's head on top of Swan's body to make Killabilly explode into nothing, and tearfully does so after expressing her love for Nick. Nick tells her he loves her, and sacrifices himself for humanity. Killabilly explodes, and in a near-death experience Nick learns from Morikawa's ghost that it has been decided Nick's honour grants him new life, with a new body, but there will be a ""mix-up"" on the resurrection. Nick learns this means he gets Morikawa's body, which is far shorter than his previous one, but neither he nor Juliet really care. Eventually, it is revealed Gideon did survive the explosion, and together the Starling family make their way home in return for Juliet's birthday, which can be a positive or negative experience depending on how the game has been played.
Should the player save all available people during the course of the game, Juliet's birthday will go swimmingly and Nick will present his present of a box of luxury lollipops to Juliet. If the player allows one or more people to die, however, Juliet's mother will act strangely and turn around to reveal she has been zombified.",,,,,16.0,,69.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,

After opening a route for future missions, they are sent to clear out machine threats for the Resistance, led by Anemone, who provides the two with support. During their missions, 2B and 9S discover that the machines are exploring human societies and concepts. The two work with a pacifist machine group led by Pascal; battle Adam and Eve, physical manifestations of the machine network who reveal that their creators were destroyed centuries ago and encounter A2, a rogue android on the run from YoRHa. Adam is killed by 2B after he captures 9S. During his recuperation, 9S discovers a glitch in YoRHa's servers when syncing himself and 2B, and learns that humanity was extinct long before the alien invasion. Their last remnant is a Moon-based server holding humanity's incomplete genome remains. YoRHa perpetuates the myth of their survival to maintain morale and give androids a ""god"" to fight for. With Adam dead, Eve goes mad with grief and drives the machines under his command into a frenzy. 2B and 9S kill Eve to end the rampage, but 9S becomes infected with Eve's logic virus, forcing 2B to kill him. However, 9S's consciousness survives within the local machine network. 
 
The third playthrough begins as YoRHa launches a full-scale invasion. A logic virus attack—enabled by the ""glitch"" that 9S previously discovered—corrupts every YoRHa unit including those in the Bunker, except for 2B and the restored 9S. 2B and 9S are separated in the aftermath, and 2B is infected with the logic virus. Discovered by A2, 2B uploads her memories into her sword and asks her to look after 9S. An ignorant 9S witnesses A2 mercifully killing 2B and swears revenge on her. Simultaneously, a tower created by the machines rises from the land, separating the two before they can fight. The perspective splits between A2 and 9S a fortnight after these events. A2—the survivor of a test run for YoRHa—finds herself empathising with the machines; she witnesses Pascal's village being destroyed, then its ""children"" committing suicide out of fear when attacked. Pascal begs A2 to either wipe his memory or kill him; A2 can perform either task or leave him. An increasingly-unbalanced 9S investigates the tower's resource-gathering platforms, fighting machine remnants and learning the tower is designed to launch a missile at the Moon server. Both eventually enter the tower, with Devola and Popola sacrificing themselves to open it.",11208.0,Limited Edition Steelbook,,[2483],,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the initial campaign in December, where his forces were unable to decisively defeat the Allies at the Battles of Pultusk and Golymin, Napoleon decided to put his army into winter quarters. The Russians, under the command of General Bennigsen, came out of winter quarters to engage in offensive operations and nearly defeated Maréchal Bernadotte's I Corps at Mohrungen. The Allies drove on Guttstadt and Allenstein but the French outmaneuvered them and the Allies were compelled to retreat. Following these actions the French army took the offensive and drove the Russians back on Eylau where both sides fought to a bloody draw. Both armies went back into winter quarters to emerge and engage once again in battle in June with the French army emerging victorious at Friedland.

Command the French at Eylau and try and defeat Bennigsen's Russian army through blinding snow of February or as the Allies defeat Napoleon at Heilsberg. At Friedland, lead your French legions to victory or as General-Lieutenant Essen at the First Battle of Ostraleka try and defeat Maréchal Lannes' V Corps before it can unite. Twenty-two historical battles await your pleasure including Eylau, where the Prussians arrived to save the day, or at Heilsberg where Napoelon's subordinates unwisely attacked the prepared positions of the Russian right wing. Can you as Maréchal Bernadotte at Mohrungen defeat the Russians before more of their forces arrive? Will your French forces under Maréchal Ney be decimated by the more numerous forces of the Russians at Güttstadt or will the French VI Corps live to fight another day? All this and more awaits you in Campaign Eylau-Friedland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The player takes control of martial artist Billy Lee, who is being hunted down by an organization called the ""Scorpions"" for murdering one of its members. The objective of the game is to fight off the members of the Scorpions and confront the true culprit, a rival martial artist named Anderson. A second player can now join in anytime via the use of a Game Link Cable, taking control of Billy's brother, Jimmy.

The combat system is simpler compared to previous Double Dragon games, including the first Game Boy game. The player can perform a series of punches or a kick on most enemies, followed by straight punch or a high kick that knocks the enemy to the floor. Pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously will cause the player to kneel. While kneeling, pressing either button will cause the player to perform an aerial uppercut. Instead of the hair grab from previous games, the player will do a collar grab (similar to Renegade), in which the player can repeatedly punch his opponent in the face or push them to the ground. While standing near a fallen enemy, a jumping knee drop can be performed. Despite the presence of armed enemies, the player cannot disarm them and pick up their weapons like in other games in the series.

The game is composed of three missions, spread across ten stages. The first two missions each consist of four stages that follows a basic structure: the player fight their way through a street until reaching the boss. This is followed by a subway platform, a fight inside a subway car, and the destination platform, where the player confronts another boss. The final mission, composed of only two stages, starts at the streets again, but this time the player must fight his way to the entrance of the Scorpions headquarters. Once inside the building, the player fight their way through a series of floors, including an area where all the previous bosses appear, until reaching the top floor where Anderson awaits. The game has three difficulty settings, but the Easy setting only allows the first mission to be played.","[1, 268435460, 268435481, 268435489, 536896720, 536897343, 536898949, 536898950, 536901615, 536902082]",[1],2022-02-23 13:26:46,https://www.igdb.com/games/double-dragon-ii,"[177112, 177113]",23548f50-466f-609f-794f-4c8b412ba1e5,,"[104554, 164461]","[58953, 58957, 58958, 83714]",49075.0,,,,,,,"[25808, 26431, 28037, 28038, 30703, 31170]",[4],[10243],"[47791, 47792]",694.0,"Your name is Billy Lee.

You learned the hard way that ""might makes right"" is the rule of law in a world where only the strong survive.
Then you saw your girlfriend get gunned down by the Black Shadow Warriors. And you felt helpless as they destroyed your home: the world-famous Double Dragon dojo, home of the mighty Double Dragon Warriors.
You knew what had to be done.
You applied every scrap of martial arts knowledge and succeeded in wiping out the Black Shadow Warriors. It wasn't easy, but you did it. Finally, you were able to rest.
But not for long.
Anxious to keep your skills sharp, you and your brother Jimmy joined the Scorpions.
You saw envy and hatred that burned in Anderson's eyes. You knew he would be trouble someday, but you never dreamed he would eliminate Wright (another Scorpion instructor), scrawl your name on the floor, and pin the blame on you! You were horrified when Gordon actually believed Anderson's twisted tale of evil and ordered you and Jimmy to pay for the crime...with your lives.
Now war has spilled out of the dojo and into the streets. You must battle countless enemies bent on your destruction, as you prowl nightmarish urban ruins in search of one man who framed you and another who ordered your death.
There must be no mercy. You must clear your name. You have all the tools you need to get the job done: fists of fire, feet of fury, and the martial arts skills of the Double Dragon.

PRODUCTION HISTORY 
Brickout! was an Intellivision version of the Atari arcade and video game Breakout. It was intended for the Triple Action cartridge, which was originally to have included five arcade-type games. Brickout! was shelved for fear of legal action from Atari; such fears also killed the original version of Astrosmash, which was an Asteroids-like game.",[1],[1],2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.igdb.com/games/brickout,,f210c6f0-ee98-3daa-6840-f560164c2dec,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hay cinco niveles en el juego, cada uno de 49 salas. Tienes que completar un nivel antes de poder llevar a tu Pulsator al siguiente. En cada nivel hay un «Pulsie» que rescatar. Esto se hace encontrando la llave que abrirá la puerta de su cárcel. 
Los Pulsators enemigos se hacen más peligrosos con cada nivel que alcances. El laberinto también se hace más difícil según cambias de nivel. 
El juego es bastante más complejo de lo que parece, no es cuestión de liarse a tiros y de encontrar la salida del laberinto. Hay seis tipos de puertas, numeradas del uno al seis, que se pueden abrir o cerrar pasando sobre unos sensores. Los sensores también están numerados de uno a seis. Si un tipo de puerta está cerrada y pasas sobre su sensor correspondiente, la puerta se abrirá. Sin embargo, si la puerta está abierta, pasando sobre el sensor, la cerrará.",,,2020-08-26 00:00:00,https://www.igdb.com/games/pulsator,,47bae6ad-590f-1486-ffc7-998b2562f1b6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dr. Nishina, the head of a genetic research facility, hires Kojiroh to investigate the disappearance of his son Shin. At the same time, Marina receives an assignment from her boss Kohno, which involves watching over a representative of an American company. As in all EVE games, the two stories appear unrelated in the beginning and are gradually linked together later in the game.

The player needs to switch between the two protagonists frequently in order to advance in the game. The interface consists of a menu that makes it possible to interact with the game world. Beside the traditional ""Look"", ""Talk"", and ""Go"" commands, there are many others, specific to the situation.

There are six game modes: Solo Normal Game, Solo Scoring Marathon, Solo vs. Computer, 2 Players @ 1 Keyboard, 2 Players. Use Network, Computer vs. Computer. If the standard tetris pieces feels too uninteresting to play with you can select to play with two other sets of pieces: ""Planar Pantominoes"" and ""One-To-Five-Ominoes"". To make the game even more interesting you can activate the ""Power Pieces""-option. A Power Piece can be one of four different kinds: The bomb (destroys all adjacent tiles), The Down (pushes each tile directly beneath it down as far as it can go), The Drip (all non-garbage tiles adjacent to it change to be the color most commonly occurring on the board) and The Skull (destroys all non-garbage tiles adjacent to it).

You know what's best for you. Choose your own hours! Choose 80 of them every week if you want!

- Meet new people

There are people diving with Oonder, LLC for all kinds of reasons. You will encounter people of all ages and from some backgrounds diving for cash.

- Listen to music while you work
(Note: Oonder is not responsible for collisions that occur while diver is distracted, and will not respond to inquiries related to incidents)

Every year, billions of dollars in assets are lost to the deep. By diving with Oonder, you can do your part to recover some of those losses for some of the biggest, most important business entities on the planet. Awesome!

We'll even lend you a submarine.

The player's ship must also be maneuvered through small holes in a series of walls where fuel cells can be picked up to restore the ship's constantly decreasing fuel supply. If the player pilots their ship successfully, they will be faced with the warlord's own escape ship which must be hit several times to be destroyed, liberating the star system from the warlord's tyranny. 
 
Each level becomes more difficult as everything will move faster, fuel will be consumed more quickly, the holes in the walls will become smaller, and more menacing defense forces will appear. 
 
Each level of game play consists of two phases: 
 
1. Passages: During the first phase of each level, the player must maneuver their ship through the narrow, moving passages with the joystick while shooting six of the warlord's defense forces with button 4. If any of the six are missed, they will go off-screen and be recycled to give the player another chance, but more fuel will be used. In addition to various defense forces which must be destroyed, there are extra targets that can be shot for additional points. Unlike the regular defense forces, the extra targets are non-threatening in that they will not shoot or crash into the player's ship. During this phase, space debris will also be shooting up through the play field. Space debris cannot be shot and can only be avoided by dodging it by moving from side to side. The walls of the narrow passage are also a danger to the player. If the player's ship crashes into a wall, a life will be lost. There are gaps between the moving walls which the player can maneuver quickly into and out of so as to avoid approaching enemies or space debris, however as game play becomes faster this will present a higher risk to crashing into oncoming walls. 
 
2. Walls: If the passages are successfully navigated and the the required six defense forces are destroyed, the player will enter the second phase. This is a series of walls with holes. In the first level of the game, there are five successive walls, each with one hole through which the player must maneuver their ship. In the second level of play, there will be six successive walls, in the third level, seven walls, etc. Also the size of the holes will become smaller in each new level. The hole will be in a different location on each wall. After passing through the hole in each wall (but prior to entering the hole in the next wall) there will be a fuel cell which must be passed to pick up. If the fuel cells are missed, the game will continue, but the fuel gauge will be continuously depleting. Note: in early levels of the game, all of the fuel cells will not need to be captured. However as the game progresses and fuel is consumed faster, all of the fuel cells will need to be captured in order to make it through the next level. 
 
After successfully completing three levels of play, the player will come face-to-face with the warlord's escape ship in open space. The warlord's ship must be shot five times to be destroyed during the first encounter, seven times on the next encounter, nine times the next, etc. The warlord's ship will shoot torpedoes at the player's ship, which can be either avoided or shot at to be destroyed. If the warlord's escape ship is destroyed, the player will enter the next level of play and the game will continue.",[268435461],,2021-03-12 12:46:34,https://www.igdb.com/games/narrow-escape,,9e637a1e-364a-2f72-b719-3e3f7f342f60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[2385],,

The team was motivated to do a game around this funny monkey. 
 
On February 02, 1989, the first prototype was ready: one level, no enemies, no musics and the monkey can jump only (no shoot). At this point, they decided to reprogram the game entirely from 0. Note JuJu Densetsu was coded with the same system used by the neogeo coders at SNK. 
 
During the first location test (at the TAD office) on September 07, 1989, many new ideas came to the developers but most of them were not included in the final product (i.e: snakes on the first stage), because lack of time. 
 
On September 15, 1989. a public location test was done in Japan AND in the USA (University of Washington). A second test was done in October. After this test, they decided to program the end of the game (done by a non-programmer in a week-end). Note: The girl you have to save is brune in the attract mode and blonde at the end. 
 
The game was finished on November 06, 1989. 
 
Then, after about 10 months of development, JuJu Densetsu was finally released on December 08, 1989 in Japan by TAD. 3148 arcade boards were sold. Export releases: ""Toki"". 
 
The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of JuJu'. 
 
The devil monkey with horns from the level 2 is called Bellzador (Dev. code name: Akuma Zaru) and has the most complex AI routine. It takes 27 pages 'A4' format in the source code. Its desing and patern were inspired by Red Arremer from Makaimura. 
 
There is some unused sprites for the character's animation in the game code. 
 
On February 26, 1990, TAD know that pirate versions of their game appear on the market. 
 
This was the last video game developed by TAD. A sequel was planned (JuJu 2! an action puzzle game) for the Super Famicom but the company closed its door 2 months after the JuJu Desnsetsu release. Fortunately, the source code of JuJu 2 was sold to Altron Corp. who released the game as ""Little Magic [Model SHVC-LI]"".

The demo of the game was released on August 21–22, 2012, at the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store.[4] 
 
There was a vote deciding which player would be on the NHL 13 cover. Anybody could vote on the player(s) they wished to see on the cover of the game. The vote started on March 29, 2012 with 60 NHL players in a single-elimination voting with two players in each match-up, and was closed on June 4, receiving over 25 million votes worldwide.[5] On June 20, Claude Giroux was named the winner, over Pekka Rinne at the 2012 NHL Awards in Las Vegas.[6] 
 
An exclusive ""Stanley Cup Collector's Edition"" was also released, apart from the actual NHL 13 game. The Collector's Edition includes five random Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) player packs from the two 2012 Stanley Cup Finals teams; a Gold Jumbo HUT pack including legend Wayne Gretzky; and a boost pack featuring the CCM RBZ stick.[7] 
 
Just like in NHL 12, Gary Thorne (play-by-play) and Bill Clement (color) provide commentary for NHL 13.[8] 
 
This year, for the first time, two playable female characters, Hayley Wickenheiser and Angela Ruggiero have been added.[9] In NHL 12, users could create female characters, but there were no real-life players.[10] 
 
On September 20, Gamesindustry.biz reported that NHL 13 had posted the best first week sales in the franchise's history.[11]","[32, 268435469, 268435470, 536870956, 536871368, 536872060, 536872078, 536872219, 536875046, 536875138, 536875157, 536875234, 536875473, 536875474, 536875562, 536876069, 536876695, 536876797, 536877488, 536878163, 536878165, 536878166, 536878167, 536878168, 536878169, 536878170, 536878171, 536878172, 536878173, 536878174, 536878175, 536878176, 536878177, 536878178, 536878179, 536878180, 536878181, 536878182, 536878183, 536878184, 536878185, 536878186, 536878187, 536878188, 536878189, 536878190, 536878415, 536882373, 536888127, 536890887, 536891211, 536891890, 536891891]",[32],2022-03-03 12:04:28,https://www.igdb.com/games/nhl-13,"[814, 37908]",6b076cc6-d56f-f0ed-2b3b-2ee43af50b7f,"[12674, 12675]","[7453, 7454]",,,,79.3427351431586,9.0,81.58803423824595,16.0,,"[44, 456, 1148, 1166, 1307, 4134, 4226, 4245, 4322, 4561, 4562, 4650, 5157, 5783, 5885, 6576, 7251, 7253, 7254, 7255, 7256, 7257, 7258, 7259, 7260, 7261, 7262, 7263, 7264, 7265, 7266, 7267, 7268, 7269, 7270, 7271, 7272, 7273, 7274, 7275, 7276, 7277, 7278, 7503, 11461, 17215, 19975, 20299, 20978, 20979]",[3],,[14205],200.0,,,,,[220],3.0,,83.8333333333333,7.0,[895],,,,,,,,

The action is shown from a top-down perspective which only shows a part of the playfield.

However, there is also a novice mode available with the usual division between a shoot and pass button. Another important option is the dribbling (novice or expert) which sets how well the ball sticks to the controlled athlete. Before starting a match, there are also some limited tactical options available (choosing the formation and switching the position of athletes around).

In contrast to the computer versions there are no pre-set tournaments, but the player can start two tournaments with customizable requirements: cup or league. The cup allows to set the number of rounds (one to four) and some rules can be switched on or off for each round individually (number of legs, extra time, penalties). The league on the other hand has the options number of teams (between one and seven), how often the teams face each other (between once and four times) and if a win rewards two or three points. The pitch type (normal, dry, wet, icy, hard or random) can be set in both modes. There are twenty national and twenty club teams (all with slightly changed original names) to choose from. General options are the game length (between three and seven minutes) as well as switching weather on or off.","[32, 268435470, 536870938, 536870939, 536871951, 536898318]",[32],2021-10-27 14:25:16,https://www.igdb.com/games/sensible-soccer-european-champions--1,"[215573, 215574]",2da15978-dfa0-0825-876c-5249a5212645,,"[146433, 146434, 146435, 146436]","[71766, 71767, 71768, 71769]",138304.0,,,,,,,"[26, 27, 1039, 27406, 30703, 31170]",[3],"[48295, 48296]",[53937],4702.0,,,,,[1110],,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the Snowball 9 orbiting Eden, the surviving crew members put Kim on trial. The only evidence against her is the ""mempak"" from the control room, which shows her as the hijacker rather than the saviour. Despite the fact that the recording is damaged and thus is unreliable, they sentence her to death. About to be thrown into space, Kim manages to escape aboard a ""stratoglider"" and an hour later, lands on Eden. At this point the game starts. 
 
The first thing the player must do is find a shelter for Kim, because a few moves into the game the Snowball 9 crew use the ship's engine to try to burn her down. The native robots take this as proof that the Snowball 9 is not the ship they were expecting but a hostile alien craft they must destroy. The objective is to contact the robots before time ends for the Snowball 9 and everyone aboard it. 
 
Development 
 
Unlike its predecessor, Return to Eden only had about two hundred and fifty locations, but it was Level 9's first game to feature graphics.[5] Other adventure games had included graphics before, but version 2 of the A-Code system, allowed Level 9 to encode location graphics into as little as forty bytes. This size made it possible to add graphics to every location of the game for all formats with more than 32 K RAM. The user could choose not to display them and play the game in text-only mode. It was released for the same platforms as its predecessor. 
 
The game's first cover depicted a robot fighting a monster plant in Enoch. The robot resembled a comic book character, so to avoid legal troubles, Level 9 commissioned Godfrey Dowson to do a new cover. Dowson's illustration depicted another robot in the jungle looking towards Enoch. Level 9 was not satisfied with the result and asked Dowson to do it again. They liked the third cover so much, they hired Dowson to do artwork for the re-release of their old games as well as for their future titles. 
 
Pete Austin commented on the game: ""It's an alien theme park gone wild. The Eden universe is more like Larry Niven's future space."" and ""...is intended as a comment on superpower intervention in the Third World.""",,,2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.igdb.com/games/silicon-dreams-return-to-eden,,97d7847e-770e-fd12-7315-8b0cefd19689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides platforming, the gameplay twist is the magic marker which introduces a creative and open approach to how puzzles can be solved. Throughout the game the magic marker will gain different powers.

The five powers are
1. Earth pillars. You can create pillars from the earth to reach higher grounds.
2. Tree branches - You can grow trees to use them as platforms, springboards, rafts and moveable objects. Branches also catch fire.
3. Vines which work like ropes. You can crawl and swing in vines, but vines can also be used to tie objects together.
4. Water streams can be shaped freely and will move objects as well as Max along their path.
5. You must destroy obstacles and defeat Mustacho’s minions.

Each of the five powers are introduced in settings similar to the power themselves. The magic marker is triggered by pressing and holding RT and controlled by the right analog stick of the Xbox One controller and while controlling the magic marker Max cannot move at all.","[1, 268435464, 268435465, 268435487, 536871075, 536871737, 536871931, 536872070, 536872205, 536872695, 536872961, 536873787, 536875046, 536875060, 536875073, 536875089, 536875090, 536875109, 536875209, 536875228, 536875229, 536875340, 536875440, 536875500, 536875650, 536875700, 536875745, 536875802, 536875808, 536875937, 536876218, 536876486, 536876572, 536877726, 536878215, 536878406, 536878407]",[1],2022-02-01 16:18:24,https://www.igdb.com/games/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood,"[1736, 59887, 66554]",82ae77c2-c30a-654c-9a53-4f6f9b3be1be,"[15697, 33122]","[56296, 56297, 56298, 56299, 58277, 58443, 129990, 129992]",,,,69.9254534564743,35.0,71.76272672823714,51.0,,"[163, 825, 1019, 1158, 1293, 1783, 2049, 2875, 4134, 4148, 4161, 4177, 4178, 4197, 4297, 4316, 4317, 4428, 4528, 4588, 4738, 4788, 4833, 4890, 4896, 5025, 5306, 5574, 5660, 6814, 7303, 7494, 7495]",[4],[10586],"[2504, 16461]",3399.0,"Max, the main protagonist of Max & the Magic Marker arrives home from school one day and finds his younger brother Felix playing in his room and smashing his beloved toys.

Dawn of War: 
Ten thousand years have passed since the treasonous acts of Chaos toppled the Golden Age of mankind. Fires burn brightly throughout the galaxies, illuminating carnage and slaughter as mankind defends itself from ancient enemies. Hardened forces collide with one goal in mind, the complete extermination of their opposition. Control one of four unique races in head-to-head or cooperative multiplayer action, where faith, skill, and strategy are requisites in ruling the universes. 
 
Winter Assault: 
The expansion pack to the award winning Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War will build upon the most exciting, visceral, front-line battlefield ever seen in an RTS game. Lost amongst the ruins of a leveled city lies an Emperor Class Titan, a war vessel of untold power forged in the planet-wide furnaces of Mars, and revered by billions as the epitome of Imperial dominance. The one who controls it will command the power to destroy, or defend, a world. The Imperials will summon it to overcome great evil, Chaos will corrupt it for their own designs, Orks will destroy it in their bloodlust and Eldar will disregard it in their arrogance. 
 
Dark Crusade: 
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade will feature two new playable races, the Tau Empire and the Necrons, bringing the number of totally unique races to an unprecedented seven. In addition to the two new playable races, Dark Crusade will feature an all-new single player campaign centering on the conquest of a ""meta-map,"" with each territory captured giving tangible rewards to the occupying force.

It was released in Japan on August 26, 2010. The word airou (アイルー airū) is the Japanese equivalent of felyne, a fictional sapient cat species that appears in all of the Monster Hunter games. The player gives orders to the felynes to progress to the end of quests instead of having direct control over them. The game also uses a much more cartoonish art style as opposed to the realism seen in other Monster Hunter games. More emphasis is placed on style and village management. A few Hello Kitty items are also available in the game. 
 
Monster Hunter Diary Poka Poka Airou Village G is an expansion pack and was released on August 10, 2011 in Japan. 
 
Monster Hunter Diary Giri Giri Airou Village is a series of ten television shorts developed to help advertise Poka Poka Airou Village. They feature felynes attempting quests and almost invariably failing at them. One episode also has a Chibiterasu cameo.

Don't forget your flashlight! The forest is so dark that you can't see anything in front of you without a flashlight!

The goal is to collect all 8 pages, maybe this will help you solve the mystery? Or is everything just at the myth stage?

The game has a very scary feature, you will always feel lost among the trees trying to find clues about the monster that haunts the forest.
You will have to collect all the pages to reach the end of the game, the pages are hidden in different locations in the forest.

An immersive experience finds players discovering – and taking part in – a rich story that explores the dark corners of human nature. It will unfold in episodes, giving players the opportunity to continue to unravel a complex mystery through downloadable content that picks up where the previous episode’s cliffhanger left off.

It is scheduled for release on both PC and console platforms.

Episode One follows an indie film crew who travels to Shady Hollow to produce a documentary on John Beaumont and the disappearance of the 2 miners. In 1975 John was accused and convicted of murdering two coal miners. During the investigation, John claimed it was the Hollow Creek Witch responsible for the disappearance of the miners.

The game will start off with Eddie being found along a lonely road by police. The police bring Eddie in for questioning in regards to the whereabouts of the remaining film makers. As Eddie tells his story, players are taken to that point in the story and play through what happened at that point.","[19, 268435468, 268435487, 268435488]",[19],2022-01-29 17:08:42,https://www.igdb.com/games/a-haunting-witching-hour,"[58354, 58355]",67ce7ff7-7c18-c0e5-c666-b905a68f1aac,[9531],[96965],,,,,,,,[13],,[1],,,2429.0,"It was in 1695 when Elizabeth Ainsley was accused of being a witch. She was betrayed by the one person she cared for the most, Rev James Beaumont. Little did he know the terror he was about to unleash upon the small town of Shady Hollow.

It wouldn’t be until the 1940’s before the Beaumont family would return to Shady Hollow. Cliff and Linda Beaumont along with their children Sally and John moved to Shady Hollow to open a coal mining operation. The woods outside of Shady Hollow were known to be rich with coal, and being in the coal business, the Beaumonts’ saw this as a great opportunity.

Several months after their arrival, their daughter Sally went missing. For weeks, the towns people searched the woods and the coal mines but all they would find is a shoe belonging to Sally by the Hollow Creek. Most believed that Sally must have fallen into the creek and drowned while others believed it was the curse of The Hollow Creek Witch.

A year later, both Cliff and Linda Beaumont grew ill and soon died. It was rumored that the loss of their daughter was too much for them to handle. John, being the sole remaining member of the Beaumont family was taken to an orphanage.

About thirty five years later (1975), John, now a grown man was approached by another mining company looking to buy the rights to the Beaumont Coal Company. The coal company was abandoned after the death of his parents so John agreed to sell his share of the company. On the morning of March 15th, 1975, John and two miners would travel through the woods to take mineral samples at one of the more lucrative mining sites in Shady Hollow. John would be the only person to return from that trip.

After several searches, the two miners were found. What the police saw would haunt them the rest of their lives. John Beaumont was immediately arrested for the murders and spent his remaining days in the Shady Hollow Mental Hospital.

In the spring of 2015, 5 indie film makers travel to Shady Hollow to do a documentary about the disappearance of the two miners in 1975 and the Beaumont family. After arriving, they soon find out that the townspeople of Shady Hollow don’t welcome outsiders and are resistant to speak about the troubled past of the town. They soon begin to uncover the urban legend of the Hollow Creek Witch that haunts the woods surrounding Shady Hollow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game's controls are dictated entirely by the Family Trainer/Power Pad. Different buttons will either cause the protagonist to jump, walk forward, walk backwards, turn left or right or switch their position to the left, right or center of the screen.

Humans have a vast assortment of weapons at their disposal, giving them an advantage at a distance. Wolves have limited ranged attacks but are much faster, stronger, and more durable than their human counterparts. 
 
 
 
The ability to switch between Human and Wolf form at any time adds an element of strategy that is wholly unique to Wolf Team. Players never need worry about running out of ammunition because Wolves have their own distinct advantages – such as running on walls then dropping onto enemies unexpectedly. In certain modes, players can even harness special Wolf mutations, such as Ghost Wolves, which can turn invisible. 
 
 
 
Variety is the spice of life; Wolf Team has several addictive game modes to choose from. Just want to engage in an all-out no-holds-barred melee? Fire up a traditional Deathmatch. Interested in joining forces with other players to wage a more cerebral, tactical battle? Try Conquest mode, in which players to work as a team to capture as many bases as possible, or Destruction mode, in which one team tries to demolish the other team's base. Wolf Team also features a large selection of weapons players can acquire as they progress through the game.","[39, 268435461, 536871378, 536872628, 536889229]",[39],2021-08-22 08:58:58,https://www.igdb.com/games/wolf-team,[160693],bbf85fac-2229-4ebc-6e2d-aa354d4c5ca1,,[112986],,,,,,,,,"[466, 1716, 18317]","[1, 2]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.[1] Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more decks of 52 cards.

The player or players are dealt an initial two card hand and add the total of their cards. Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are counted as ten points. The player and dealer can count their own Ace as 1-point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a ""hit"" (taking additional cards) to bring their total value of cards to 21 points, or as close as possible without exceeding 21 (called ""busting""). If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is called ""soft"", meaning that the player cannot go bust by taking an additional card; otherwise, the hand is ""hard"".

The dealer has to take hits until his cards total 17 or more points. (In some casinos, the dealer also hits on a ""soft"" 17, e.g. initial ace and six.) Players who do not bust and have a total higher than the dealer, win. The dealer will lose if he or she busts, or has a lesser hand than the player who has not busted. If the player and dealer have the same point total, this is called a ""push"" and the player typically doesn't win or lose money on that hand.

Many rule variations of blackjack exist. Since the 1960's, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards that have been dealt and adapt their wager and playing strategies accordingly.

Other casino games inspired by blackjack include Spanish 21 and pontoon. The recreational British card game of black jack is a shedding-type game and unrelated to the subject of this article.","[268435489, 536874083]",,2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.igdb.com/games/blackjack-daily-21-points,[71859],23ae4b4a-a594-f9b9-d8dc-0433f9627ce5,,,,,,,,,,,[3171],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Released on March 18, 2003, the Rainbow Six video game series is based on Tom Clancy's best-selling novel of the same name. 
 
Based on the Unreal Engine 2.0, Raven Shield is a tactical shooter with realistic properties. Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one's weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer. 
 
A console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version's success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. The next full game in the Rainbow Six series, Rainbow Six: Lockdown, was released in 2005.",[268435461],,2020-11-06 00:00:00,https://www.igdb.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-3-black-arrow,,37e9d315-5a7a-6f5d-1f0b-d1ed479fd74c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, the player must successfully launch the shuttle into space by performing quick time events that correspond to particular shuttle launch maneuvers such as booster rocket separation. Once in space, one of several missions will be played where the player must control the astronaut by maneuvering him around hazards, replenish his air supply before the timer runs out, and deliver components for the International Space Station to their correct locations.

Space Fever is a 1979 arcade game by Nintendo R&D2. Some sources claim that Ikegami Tsushinki also did design work on Space Fever. It was released in both monochrome and color versions. The gameplay is similar to Space Invaders, which had been released by Taito in 1978. It was distributed by Far East Video. 
 
The gameplay of Space Fever is reminiscent of Space Invaders (1978), where the player controls a laser cannon situated at the bottom of the screen and must defeat waves of enemy aliens. The aliens are arranged in rows and slowly move to the edge of the screen, before descending and continuing in the opposite direction. As more aliens are defeated, they increase in speed. A UFO will occasionally appear towards the top of the screen, which can be shot down for bonus points. There are three game modes that change the way the aliens move; the first presents two formations of enemies that move in opposite directions, the second continuously adds additional rows of aliens, and the third is functionally identical to Space Invaders.","[18, 268435461, 268435465, 268435489, 536871078, 536871881, 536871882, 536873255]",[18],2022-02-14 00:30:51,https://www.igdb.com/games/space-fever,"[175965, 175966]",64702926-671f-d61e-a9f7-43a54d78882b,,"[123347, 123348, 123408, 123409, 123410]",[58306],,,,,,,,"[166, 969, 970, 2343]",[4],"[9942, 9943, 9944]",[47471],,,,,,,,,,,[13905],,,[131143],,,,,

The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot 'em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work. 
 
You have a single ship choice and three difficulties. Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD, which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL, and isn't particularly challenging anyway. You get two extra credits in NORMAL, for a total of 5, which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending. No one should touch EASY, since it limits you to reaching Stage 4. There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings, none of which are affected by credit usage. 
 
Power-ups consist of 2 main shots (RED and BLUE), 2 sub-weapons (YELLOW and GREEN), and an eIntense Shot' based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb. Main weapons stack up to 3 times (RED: starts on 1 shot then 2, 3 and finally 4 shots), sub-weapons don't stack. Lose a ship and you lose your sub-weapon, while your main weapon goes down one level. 
 
BLUE is the Laser Shot, a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it. The laser's eintense shot' is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path. RED is Needle Shot. This is your typical V-shot weapon. Less powerful than BLUE, but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread. The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses, making this the best main weapon. GREEN is the Cipher Wave, the best sub-weapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you, which is essential during boss fights. YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional V-shot weapon. Absolute rubbish. 
 
With such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the game's duration. Which isn't a criticism. Gaia Seed doesn't distract you with superfluity; it's functional, with a focus on dodging and shooting. What's especially cool, and sets it apart from other shmups, is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging. This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health - but it doesn't break the game's balancing. 
 
Enemies frequently use screen-filling beam-based draining weapons, forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beam's attack before your life is fully drained. With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance - especially if you're trying to beat them by letting the timer run down (those are some pretty intense 120 seconds). After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screen's edge, healing while avoiding bullet patterns. The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving. A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine, which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance (as pointed out by Mag Weasel). 
 
A mention must go to Gaia Seed's timed bosses. Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesn't do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment, but if you want to see the best ending you'll let the two final Stage 7 bosses' live. 
 
Visually almost everything is sprite based, though it varies in terms of quality. The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around, while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects. Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling, though not as good as in Thunder Force IV. Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair. 
 
The stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack, which almost warrants download alone. It's extremely unconventional, being a blend of ambient music with chanting, classical music, hip-hop and thumping techno. Stage 2's track almost sounds as if it's been taken from Panzer Dragoon Saga. It's eclectic, strange, and very good. The sole composer was Xacs Ishikawa, also known as Naoto Ishikawa, a fairly obscure composer connected to works like Psyvariar and Touhou. Interestingly, he also collaborated with Harumi Shiina to remix Koji Endo's King's Field soundtrack, to create an album called Invitation to the Graveyard ~ King's Field I Arrange Collection.","[18, 268435461, 536871078, 536871882, 536875151]",[18],2021-03-30 08:15:09,https://www.igdb.com/games/gaia-seed-project-seed-trap,,122c8f31-fe37-7ebf-0e17-90b01cea2722,,,,,,,,,,,"[166, 970, 4239]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One day, he meets a strange girl, Kirari Shiino, at work and before he knows it, they've formed a punk band. 
 
The band consists of Shikanosuke, Kirari, his childhood friend Chie Isurugi, and a rich but weak young lady by the name of Sarina Kashiwara. The four of them are members of the Second Literature Club, which has hardly any active members and is already scheduled to be disbanded. This band is their chance to stand out and give one final farewell at the Culture Festival. 
 
The challenge was foolhardy, but after eccentric training they managed to succeed and rock out the peaceful Oubi Academy with their debut performance. That should have been it. 
They were satisfied. 
They should have returned to their normal lives. 
However, their final performance at a local Live House became a hit on the Internet and requests for their performance start flying in from far and wide. 
 
One problem: exams are coming up and their parents are opposed to the band! 
 
Who cares!
